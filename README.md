# React application with Express node server

# Idea
Starter project to deploy fullstack projects on heroku

## Using this project

1. Clone the project, change into the directory and install the dependencies.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/philnash/react-express-starter.git
   cd react-express-starter
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file for environment variables in your server.

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

3. Start the server

   You can start the server on its own with the command:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

   Run the React application on its own with the command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Run both applications together with the command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The React application will run on port 3000 and the server port 3001.

## React Twilio starter

The [twilio branch](https://github.com/philnash/react-express-starter/tree/twilio) is a similar setup but also provides endpoints with basic [Access Tokens](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/access-tokens) for [Twilio Programmable Chat](https://www.twilio.com/docs/chat) and [Twilio Programmable Video](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video). You can use the project as a base for building React chat or video applications.
